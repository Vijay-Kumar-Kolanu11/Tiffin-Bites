<h1>Tiffin Bites</h1>

Built a responsive menu catalog web page listing multiple tiffin items (e.g. Idli, Masala Dosa, Poha) with images and pricing.

Implemented a cart/order summary UI showing total items & total cost, dynamically updating as users add items.

Included “About Us” section with business info (timings, location, story) to enhance credibility and context.

Developed feedback form (name, email, rating, comments) to collect user opinions and improve engagement.

Ensured clean navigation (Menu, About, Feedback) for ease of use.

Designed with mobile-friendly layout and intuitive visuals (images, buttons, plus/minus quantity selectors).

Deployed the static frontend on Netlify for fast hosting and easy access.

Paid attention to detail: item-price display, image usage, UX clarity.
